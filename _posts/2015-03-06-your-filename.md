## An Essay

when I was young, I dont have any toy, I only play with dirt, in the lake, along the river, There are so many thing are unknown, even to my parents, so they made up so story, after i grew up, in the school, after teacher's scientific explaination, It all started to make sense to me, If only when I was before school age, I have means to get the right infomation not the old saying of my parents' parents, It would have opened my mind in very young age, I think If one can start young and learn the right thing for once, not to learn the wrong one first then correct it,I would prefer the first choice over the other one.
